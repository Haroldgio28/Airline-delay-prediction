# PredictUSFlights - Flight Delay Prediction

PredictUSFlights is an innovative solution designed to tackle one of the most significant challenges in the aviation industry in the USAâ€”flight delays. Delays not only affect customer satisfaction but also represent a considerable economic burden for airlines and impact the broader economy. By leveraging advanced predictive analytics, this project aims to transform raw data into actionable insights, enabling airlines to optimize operations, improve passenger experiences, and minimize unnecessary costs.

The significance of predicting flight delays extends beyond mere operational improvements; it's a strategic tool that can lead to a competitive advantage. As airlines strive to ensure punctuality, the ability to anticipate and mitigate potential delays can be a game-changer. For passengers, it translates to better travel planning and a more reliable journey. For airlines, it means enhanced resource management, reduced overheads from prolonged delays, and a more robust flight schedule.

Through the use of historical data, PredictUSFlights serves as a crucial decision-support tool for airline operators, airport authorities, and logistical planners across the United States. The economic implications of delay predictions are profound, ranging from saving millions in operational costs to bolstering the reliability of air transport as a means of connecting people and businesses across the country.

This project is for stakeholders in the aviation sector looking for a technical edge, data scientists interested in practical applications of machine learning, and software developers aiming to contribute to the next wave of travel technology. Join us in shaping the future of flight travel where on-time performance is not just a goal but a standard.

The model has an **accuracy of 66% and an area under curve of 0.72.**

This project is part of the Mid-term Project for [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp)

```
For make a prediction about a specific flight, there are two ways:

1. Open the [notebook](https://github.com/Haroldgio28/Airline-delay-prediction/blob/main/notebooks/predict-test.ipynb) on Visual Studio Code or other code editor, and change the parameters.
2. In another command line, execute the [script](https://github.com/Haroldgio28/Airline-delay-prediction/blob/main/predict-test.py), changing the parameters on the script.


## Next Steps

- Deploy this solution to a cloud (AWS)
- Iterate with XGBoost Classifier Model
